Picture Url
===========

There is a small issue when views integration with services module. We can't get the url of the image to webservices. There is a module for this. https://www.drupal.org/project/image_url_formatter.

But here one issue remaining is that the image_url_formatter module doesn't work with user profile picture. 

Picture Url module handle this small snippet. 

Thank you
